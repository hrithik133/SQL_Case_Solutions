Problem Statement:
The finance and HR departments require an efficient method to identify newly hired employees who are already earning above a certain salary threshold. This report will help in budget planning, salary reviews, and assessing the distribution of company resources towards employee compensation.

Variable and Table Description:
The 'Employee' table in the company's database has the following structure:

employee_id: Integer - a unique identifier for each employee.
name: String - the employee's full name.
months: Integer - the total number of months the employee has been working at the company.
salary: Integer - the employee's monthly salary.

Solution:
An SQL query is designed to select employee names who have a salary greater than $2000 and have been employed for less than 10 months. The results will be sorted by the employee_id in ascending order to maintain the sequence of hiring. The query is as follows:

SELECT name
FROM employee
WHERE salary > 2000 AND months < 10
ORDER BY employee_id;
