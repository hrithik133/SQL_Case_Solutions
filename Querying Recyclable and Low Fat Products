# Recyclable and Low Fat Products Case Study

## Problem Statement

We need to identify products that are both low in fats and recyclable from our product inventory. The goal is to promote environmentally friendly and healthy living options.

## Database Schema

The database contains a single table, `Products`, structured as follows:

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| product_id  | int  |
| low_fats    | enum |
| recyclable  | enum |

### Constraints

- `product_id` is the primary key for this table, meaning each value is unique.
- `low_fats` is an ENUM of type ('Y', 'N'), where 'Y' indicates the product is low fat, and 'N' indicates it is not.
- `recyclable` is an ENUM of types ('Y', 'N'), where 'Y' means the product is recyclable, and 'N' means it is not.

## Objective

Write a SQL query to find the IDs of products that are both low fat (`low_fats = 'Y'`) and recyclable (`recyclable = 'Y'`).

### Example

#### Input

Products table:

| product_id | low_fats | recyclable |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 0          | Y        | N          |
| 1          | Y        | Y          |
| 2          | N        | Y          |
| 3          | Y        | Y          |
| 4          | N        | N          |

#### Output

| product_id |
|------------|
| 1          |
| 3          |

#### Explanation

Only products 1 and 3 meet the criteria of being both low fat and recyclable.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
