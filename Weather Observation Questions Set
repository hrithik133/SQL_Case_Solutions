This business case proposes a strategy for targeted marketing campaigns focusing on cities based on many different criteria. It is based on the hypothesis that these cities exhibit unique cultural or economic characteristics that may increase the effectiveness of tailored advertising and promotional efforts.

Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

Solution:

SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'A%' 
   OR UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'E%' 
   OR UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'I%' 
   OR UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'O%' 
   OR UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'U%';

Problem:
Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.

Solution:

SELECT COUNT(CITY) - COUNT(DISTINCT(CITY))
FROM STATION;

Problem:
Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

Solution:

(SELECT CITY, CHAR_LENGTH(CITY) AS LENGTH
FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH ASC, CITY ASC
LIMIT 1)
UNION
(SELECT CITY, CHAR_LENGTH(CITY) AS LENGTH
FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH DESC, CITY ASC
LIMIT 1);

Problem:
Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

Solution:

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE UPPER(CITY) LIKE '%A' OR
      UPPER(CITY) LIKE '%E' OR
      UPPER(CITY) LIKE '%I' OR
      UPPER(CITY) LIKE '%O' OR
      UPPER(CITY) LIKE '%U';

Problem:

Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

Solution:

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE ((UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'A%') OR (UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'E%') OR (UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'I%') OR (UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'O%') OR (UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'U%')) 
       AND 
      ((UPPER(CITY) LIKE '%A') OR (UPPER(CITY) LIKE '%E') OR (UPPER(CITY) LIKE '%I') OR (UPPER(CITY) LIKE '%O') OR (UPPER(CITY) LIKE '%U'));

Problem:

Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

Solution:

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE NOT(UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'A%') AND
      NOT(UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'E%') AND
      NOT(UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'I%') AND
      NOT(UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'O%') AND
      NOT(UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'U%');

Problem:

Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

Solution:

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE NOT (UPPER(CITY) LIKE '%A') AND
NOT (UPPER(CITY) LIKE '%E') AND
NOT (UPPER(CITY) LIKE '%I') AND
NOT (UPPER(CITY) LIKE '%O') AND
NOT (UPPER(CITY) LIKE '%U');

Problem:

Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

Solution:

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE NOT
((UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'A%' OR UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'E%' OR UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'I%' OR UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'O%' OR UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'U%') 
AND
(UPPER(CITY) LIKE '%A' OR UPPER(CITY) LIKE '%E' OR UPPER(CITY) LIKE '%I' OR UPPER(CITY) LIKE '%O' OR UPPER(CITY) LIKE '%U'));
