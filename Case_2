Background
In a database, we manage customer data where each customer may be referred by another customer. Our goal is to identify customers who were not referred by a specific customer, in this case, the customer with id = 2.

Database Schema
The database contains a single table named Customer, outlined below:

Table: Customer
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| referee_id  | int     |
+-------------+---------+

id is the primary key for this table and represents the customer's unique identifier.
name is the customer's name.
referee_id is the id of the customer who referred them. This can be null if the customer was not referred by another customer.
Task
Write an SQL query to find the names of customers who were not referred by the customer with id = 2.

Requirements
Your SQL query should return the names of the relevant customers.
The result should be returned in any order.

Consider the following Customer table data:

+----+------+------------+
| id | name | referee_id |
+----+------+------------+
| 1  | Will | null       |
| 2  | Jane | null       |
| 3  | Alex | 2          |
| 4  | Bill | null       |
| 5  | Zack | 1          |
| 6  | Mark | 2          |
+----+------+------------+

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT name
FROM customer
WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;
