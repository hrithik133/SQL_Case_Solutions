Problem Statement:
We need to develop a data analysis solution to identify "big" countries from our database based on specific criteria. A country is considered "big" if it meets either of the following conditions:

It has an area of at least three million square kilometers (3000000 kmÂ²).
It has a population of at least twenty-five million people (25000000).
Objective:
The primary objective is to create a SQL query that retrieves the name, population, and area of the significant countries from the "World" database based on the provided criteria.

Requirements:

Develop a SQL query that selects the name, population, and area columns from the "World" table.
Use a CASE statement within the SQL query to evaluate each country based on the defined criteria for being "big."
Filter the results to include only countries that meet the criteria for being "big."
The query should return the results in any order.
Data:
The "World" table contains the following columns:

name (Primary Key): The name of the country.
continent: The continent to which the country belongs.
area: The area of the country in square kilometers.
population: The population of the country.
gdp: The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country.

World Table:
+-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+
| name        | continent | area    | population | gdp          |
+-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+
| Afghanistan | Asia      | 652230  | 25500100   | 20343000000  |
| Albania     | Europe    | 28748   | 2831741    | 12960000000  |
| Algeria     | Africa    | 2381741 | 37100000   | 188681000000 |
| Andorra     | Europe    | 468     | 78115      | 3712000000   |
| Angola      | Africa    | 1246700 | 20609294   | 100990000000 |
+-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+

Solution

SELECT name, population, area
FROM World
WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000;
