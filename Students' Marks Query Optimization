Problem Statement:
There is a need to efficiently retrieve and sort student data based on their performance, specifically to identify students who have achieved marks above a certain threshold. This process must also take into consideration the sorting of names based on the last three characters, which is essential for a particular reporting format required by the educational institution's administration.

Variable and Table Description:
The database contains a table named 'STUDENTS' with the following columns:

ID: An integer identifier for each student.
Name: A string representing the student's name.
Marks: An integer value representing the student's marks.

Solution:
The proposed SQL query will extract the names of students who scored above 75 marks. It will use the RIGHT() function to sort the names by the last three characters, and in cases where the last three characters are identical, it will sort by the ID in ascending order. This approach ensures a precise and organized list suitable for the administration's needs.

SELECT Name
FROM Students
WHERE Marks > 75
ORDER BY RIGHT(Name, 3), ID ASC;
